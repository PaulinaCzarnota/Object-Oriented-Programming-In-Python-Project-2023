This is my Python project for a **School Management System**, developed during my second year of Computer Science at TU Dublin. 

# Project Overview

The system utilizes object-oriented programming principles to effectively manage student administration across multiple subjects, including Math, History, and English. 

## Key Features:

- **CRUD Operations:** Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionalities for managing student records.
- **Grade Computation:** Automatic calculation of final grades based on student performance.
- **Data Persistence:** Use of external files to ensure data is saved and retrievable.
- **Summary Reports:** Generation of comprehensive reports summarizing student performance and statistics.

This project serves as a practical application of programming concepts and demonstrates my ability to create functional software solutions.
