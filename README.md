This is my Python project for a School Management System completed in the second year of Computer Science at TU Dublin. 

It leverages object-oriented programming to efficiently manage student administration across Math, History, and English subjects. Key features include CRUD operations, computation of final grades, data persistence using external files, and generation of summary reports. Let me know if you need further improvements or additions.
